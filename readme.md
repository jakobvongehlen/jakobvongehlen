Undergraduate in Business Informatics. Through my courses and independent studies, I have developed a strong interest in financial technology and cybersecurity, particularly at the intersection of payments, risk and investment management. I aim to contribute to the development of innovative solutions that enhance efficiency and security in these areas.
